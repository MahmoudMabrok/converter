## Requirements

To run this app on your local machine there are some dependencies you have to install first. These **dependencies** are:

* [ ` node ` ](https://nodejs.org/en/)  

    You should download it and install on your machine

* [ ` redux ` ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)  

    A great standalone tool to manage ** state change ** and decreases ** components coupling ** .

* [ ` react-redux ` ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux)  

    Since ` redux ` 
    is a standalone tool that is not dedicated to ** React JS ** , we need another package to hook it within a ** React JS ** app and here ` react-redux ` 
    comes to the scene.

* [ ` bootstrap ` ](https://getbootstrap.com/)  

    **Bootstrap** is the most popular **CSS Framework** for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

    **Bootstrap** 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap

* [ ` react-bootstrap ` ](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)  

    **React bootstrap** replaces the Bootstrap javascript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true **React** component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

* [ ` react-router-dom ` ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

    React Router is the most popular routing library for React. It allows you define routes in the same declarative style:

``` js
    < Route path = "/home" component = {Home} />
```

## Challenges
There were two challenges **first**, how to store all units in a hierarchy that makes it easy to them and extract them show them in the screen as next image:
